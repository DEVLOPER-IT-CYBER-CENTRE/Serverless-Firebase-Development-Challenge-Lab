Google Cloud Self-Paced Labs

Overview
In a challenge lab youâ€™re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the quest to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

This lab is recommended for students who are enrolled in the Serverless Firebase Development quest. Are you ready for the challenge?

Prerequisites
In this challenge lab you will be assessed on your knowledge of the following areas:

Firestore

Cloud Run

Cloud Build

Container Registry

Setup
Before you click the Start Lab button
Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

What you need
To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Time to complete the lab.
Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab.

Note: If you are using a Pixelbook, open an Incognito window to run this lab.

Provision the environment
Link to the project:

gcloud config set project $(gcloud projects list --format='value(PROJECT_ID)' --filter='qwiklabs-gcp')
Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/rosera/pet-theory.git
Challenge scenario
In this lab you will create a frontend solution using a Rest API and Firestore database. Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database that is part of the Firebase platform where you can store, sync, and query data for your mobile and web apps at scale. Lab content is based on resolving a real world scenario through the use of Google Cloud serverless infrastructure.

You will build the following architecture:

To complete this section successfully, you are required to implement the following tasks:

Access pet-theory/lab06/firebase-rest-api/solution-01

Build and Deploy the code to Google Container Registry

Deploy the image as a Cloud Run Service

curl -X GET $SERVICE_URL should respond with:

{"status":"Netflix Dataset! Make a query."}

Click Check my progress to verify that you've performed the above task.
Deploy and test the REST API

Task 4: Firestore API access
In this scenario, deploy an updated revision of the code to access the Firestore DB.

A high level architecture diagram below summarizes the general architecture.

Cloud Run Service	netflix-dataset-service
Permission	--allow-unauthenticated
To complete this section successfully, you are required to implement the following tasks:

Access pet-theory/lab06/firebase-rest-api/solution-02
Build the updated application
Use Cloud Build to tag and deploy image revision to Container Registry
Deploy the new image as Cloud Run service
curl -X GET $SERVICE_URL/2019 should respond with json dataset
Click Check my progress to verify that you've performed the above task.
Deploy and test the Rest API

Task 5: Deploy the Staging Frontend
In this scenario, deploy the Staging Frontend.

A high level architecture diagram below summarizes the general architecture.
